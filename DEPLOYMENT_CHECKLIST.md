- [ ] Root Directory: `./` (default)
- [ ] Build Command: `npm run build` (default)
- [ ] Output Directory: `.next` (default)

### 3. Set Up Database

  - [ ] Trending (/trending)  
  - [ ] Graph (/graph)
  - [ ] Sources (/sources)

### Initialize Database
- [ ] Go to Sources page

- [ ] Filter by tags and sources
- [ ] View individual story pages
- [ ] Test on mobile device

## Automatic Deployments ‚úÖ

Once set up, these happen automatically:

- [ ] Every `git push` to main branch ‚Üí new deployment
- [ ] Every pull request ‚Üí preview deployment
- [ ] Database stays connected automatically
- [ ] Zero additional configuration needed

## Troubleshooting üîß

If something goes wrong:

1. **Check Vercel deployment logs** - Shows build errors
2. **Check function logs** - Shows runtime errors  
3. **Verify environment variables** - Database connection issues
4. **Test locally first** - Run `npm run build` and `npm start`

## Quick Commands üìù

```bash
# Test locally before deploying
npm run build
npm run start

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck

# Deploy via CLI (alternative)
npx vercel --prod
```
